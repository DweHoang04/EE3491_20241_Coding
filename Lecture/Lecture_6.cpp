/*

printf(), scanf()
input/output in C++
* Differences between define, const, and enum:
- define: Does not provided with a memory slot. And it could be a function.
- const: Provided with a memory slot.
- enum: Only suitable with number-type data.

* Note: Macro is fast but we should not use it often since it might get wrong 
type off data, and don't overwrite (or simply write wrong code) it since is 
not "visual-friendly".
